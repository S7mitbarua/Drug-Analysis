# Prescription Drug Analysis
## Overview
This project focuses on the analysis of simulated real-world substance prescription data to uncover trends in drug usage, identify potential side effects, and explore adherence patterns. The synthetic dataset mimics real-world scenarios, incorporating various drug classes, health conditions, and patient adherence levels.

## Introduction
Understanding patterns in drug prescription data is crucial for healthcare professionals and policymakers. This project aims to provide insights into prescription trends, medication adherence, and potential side effects, utilizing a simulated dataset with realistic characteristics.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis is a synthetic prescription dataset generated to simulate real-world scenarios. It includes information about patients, drug classes, specific medications, associated health conditions, adherence levels, and potential side effects.

## Setup
To run the analysis, you can use Google Colab, a Jupyter notebook environment in the cloud.

## Analysis Steps
- **Load Data:** Load the simulated prescription data into a Pandas DataFrame.
- **Explore Data:** Understand the structure of the dataset and check for missing values.
- **Drug Usage Trends:** Analyze prescription data to identify commonly prescribed drugs.
- **Correlate Medications:** Investigate correlations between specific medications and health conditions.
- **Side Effects Analysis:** Explore potential side effects associated with medications.
- **Adherence Patterns:** Analyze patterns and factors influencing medication adherence.

## Results
The analysis reveals insights into drug usage patterns, correlations between medications and health conditions, potential side effects, and adherence patterns. Visualizations help interpret the findings.

## Usage
Follow the provided code snippets in the analysis notebook to load your prescription data and perform similar analyses. Customize the code to match your specific dataset and research questions.
